# Guess the number

A guess the number type game written in HTML/CSS/JS. You should choose a random number between 1 and 100 in 10 turns. After each turn the game will warn
if you are right or wrong, and if you are wrong, whether the number was too low or too high. The game will end once the player guesses correctly, or once they run out of turns.

This is a basic implementation based on the lessons of Gabriela Pinheiro available on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash).
